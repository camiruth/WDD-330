        <h3>Chapter 9: The Window Object</h3>
        <li>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen</li>
        <li>Three functions that produced dialogs in the browsers: alert(), confirm() and prompt(). All major browsers support the window object with these dialogs.</li>
        <li>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page.</li>
        <li>The protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http, https, pop2, ftp etc.)</li>
        <li>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser session. </li>
        <li>The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on</li>
        <li>Each window object contains a document object</li>
        <li>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. Cookies can be used for personalizing a user’s browsing experience, storing user preferences, keeping track of user choices (such as a shopping cart), authentication and tracking users. </li>
        <li>To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript’s “cookie jar”, using the document.cookie property</li>
        <li>Adding the string ; secure to the end of a cookie will ensure it’s only transmitted over a secure HTTPS network:</li>
        <li>The window.setInterval() method works in a similar way to window.setTimeout(), except that it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of milliseconds</li>
        <li>The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page</li>
        <li>The window.requestAnimationFrame() method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing the browser's built-in graphics capabilities. It can be canceled using the cancelAnimationFrame() method.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3>Chapter 14: HTML5 API's</h3>
        <li>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. </li>
        <li>Data attributes provide a convenient way of adding data directly into the HTML markup, enabling a richer user experience</li>
        <li>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use.</li>
        <li>Every time a value is saved to local storage, a storage event is fired. </li>
        <li>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. </li>
        <li>Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server – also known as push messaging. This means that a connection is kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are received.</li>
        <li>The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's notifications.</li>
        <li>HTML5 introduced the <audio> and <video> tags used to insert audio and video clips into a web page. It also introduced a Media API for controlling the playback of the clips using JavaScript.</li>
        <li>The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn onto a web page in real time using JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Shims and Polyfills are libraries of code that allow you to use the APIs as usual. They then fill in the necessary code that's not provided natively by the user’s browser.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Questions</h3>
        <li>Is the Block 2 assignment that we are creating due in week 14? </li>
        <li>Will there be a time that we can get feedback on our project before we have to submit it?</li>
    </ul>
