  <h1>Week 1 Notes</h1>
  <a href="./readingPractice/story_editor.html">Story Editor Practice</a>
  <ul>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <li>Created array in js to hold the labels and urls to each weeks notes and activities.</li>
    <li>Created a for loop for the li and a in my ol that is in my html code. This is all for the master table of
      contents to keep everything I am doing organized.</li>
    <li>Set up Visual Studio Code linked to my GitHub Repository. This was easier if the instructions would have been
      through VS code and not through GitHub. I ended up doing it twice because it was much easier to set it up for me
      through VS code.</li>
    <li>The GitHub pages was giving my problems but i finally figured that out as well.</li>
    <li>Output: Anything being stored or shared with the user. Input: Anything the user enters.</li>
    <li>Square brackets are arrays</li>
    <li>Curly Brackets are objects</li>
    <li>Var is variable(global), let (current variable), const (is a constant)</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <h3>SitePoint</h3>
    <li>Make everything designed for mobile first as most interfaces are used on phones and not computers.</li>
    <li>Provide the user with what they need. Make your app quick, it changes if people stay or leave from your app. Users use one hand on a small device. </li>
    <li>Speed Matters... Reduce image usage, SVG/Webfonts are lower bandwidth, Optimize and Minify CSS and JS files</li>
    <li>Primary Controls.. nav bar at the bottom for more accessibility. Adding Menu instead of Hamburger will add more clicks to it. </li>
    <li>Add label text inside the form instead of on the outside. Float labels help so you don't lose the text when you start typing. </li>
    <li>Autofill is good for phones. If the user is entering numbers, use the number keypad. Link phone numbers to click and call instead of copy and paste.</li>
    <li>Keep advertising smaller and then reveal when clicked. Do not use pop ups and popovers.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <li>What is the difference of putting the ol list in the HTML over making it in js?</li>
    <li>For my loop in javascript this week, I used a for loop and the teacher used if. Is there a difference?</li>
    <li>What are the benefits of having a link open in a new tab or not?</li>
  </ul>
