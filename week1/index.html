    <li>Set up Visual Studio Code linked to my GitHub Repository. This was easier if the instructions would have been through VS code and not through GitHub. I ended up doing it twice because it was much easier to set it up for me through VS code.</li>
    <li>The GitHub pages was giving my problems but i finally figured that out as well.</li>
    <li>Output: Anything being stored or shared with the user. Input: Anything the user enters.</li>
